    <h3>Chicken Mandi</h3>
    <p>Chicken mandi is prepared with a blend of aromatic spices, including cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and black lime. These spices give the dish a complex and enticing flavor profile that appeals to many. The chicken used in mandi is often marinated in a mixture of yogurt and spices before being slow-cooked. Mandi is typically served with fragrant basmati rice that's been cooked with the same flavorful spices and juices from the chicken.</p>
